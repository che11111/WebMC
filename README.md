#### Remarks:

How to use this website to enter a Minecraft server?
You need to configure the EaglerXBungee plugin on the BungeeCord side of the server you want to enter. In this way, you can use EaglercraftX_1.8 to enter a Minecraft server in version 1.8.
If you want to use EaglercraftX_1.8 to enter a server of a higher version, please also configure the ViaVersion plugin on the BungeeCord side. In this way, you can enter servers from version 1.8 to 1.21 or even higher versions.
